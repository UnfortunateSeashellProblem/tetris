# Tetris

A fun side project I worked on before starting at Hack Reactor. This is a basic tetris game built using vanilla Javascript, HTML and CSS. I built this game by following kubowania's Free Code Camp Tutorial.


## Installation

To run the game simply clone this repository down to your desktop, and navigate to the index.html's file location in your browser

For example:
```bash
file:///home/user/Desktop/tetris/basic-tetris/index.html
```
